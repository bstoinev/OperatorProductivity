Magic strings
	Use configuration instead of hardcoded connection strings. [FIXED]

Memory leak - improper usage of disposable objects. [FIXED]
	
DataReader misuse [FIXED]
	In order to execute subsequent commands against a connection, a DataReader must be closed.
	Whilst this is not an issue in the OperatorReport action method, closure of the SqlDataReader shows that the routine is developed conciously and in full.
	
No views for all the action methods [FIXED]

No error handling [FIXED]
	SQL Server might be innaccessible. Show user friendly message instead of YSOD.

No logging.
	Ease the diagnostics of future problems by adding logging capabilities.

Reading data 
	Performance gain might be obtained using the DataReader's Get* methods, instead of Convert.To* methods. [FIXED]

Wrong data type
	TotalChatLength and AverageChatLength properties are numbers as opposed to strings [FIXED]
	
Complexity overhead
	Unless some specific behavior is necessary in a collection, don't create ClassCollection (OperatorReportItems) as it brings more complexity to the project.
	Instead do use generics as in List<OperatorReportViewModel>

Multiple classes in a single file.
	Having this in a small project is fine. 
	But when source control system is involved you might want to have one class per file, which is identically named.
	Also, it's easier to force this simple rule in a team, instead of requiring developers to follow some logic for grouping of classes.

Decreased readability of the OperatorProductivity stored procedure
	Use of Common Table Expressions instead of subqueries greatly improves the readability of the SP's code. 

Offload the DB engine
	The database is likely the most heavily loaded component of a system. 
	So calculating scalars doesn't make much sense as it consumes system resources and increases the payload sent over the wire.
	I recommend removal of the rate fields from the returned data. See OperatorProductivityRaw stored procedure.
	Next, the application could do the calculations during the population of the view model.

Conceptual error
	Operator report view model is not the same as a single row in the operator report table. 
	So OperatorReportViewModel is implemented wrong. 
	Instead, it must contains an enumerable of operator report rows as well as the properties for filtering the data.
	See OperatorReportItem, OperatorReportViewModelRef for details.

UI improvment
	Change the drop-down lists to checkbox lists to allow slection of one or more but not all of the options.
